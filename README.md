AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (AI-PIDS) ðŸš€
A real-time, AI-driven intrusion detection system leveraging machine learning for high-accuracy threat detection.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
AI-PIDS is an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that utilizes machine learning (XGBoost) to analyze network traffic and detect malicious activity. It processes live packet captures, extracts key network features, and classifies them in real time.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Real-time Packet Capture & Analysis using pyshark
âœ… AI-Powered Threat Detection with XGBoost
âœ… Optimized Preprocessing for handling large datasets (3GB+)
âœ… Scalable & GPU Compatible (CUDA Support for Faster Execution)
âœ… Logging & Alert System to flag potential intrusions
